## About iTrack

Welcome to the iTrack app, navigating lifesaving routes, while avoiding train delays.

This app was made for the 2023 `Congressional App Challenge` and the link for the video
demonstration can be found here -> https://youtu.be/faAz6IUvo9c

## Purpose

This app is designed to help emergency vehicles and individuals avoid train delays on their way to their preferred destination. Here's how it works: First, it takes your current location and your desired destination. Then, it calculates how long it will take for you to get there. Next, it checks if your route includes a railroad track. If it does, the app checks if there's a train scheduled to pass at the same time you'll be crossing. If there is, the app reroutes you to a faster alternative to make sure you don't get held up by the train. It's a smart way to ensure a smooth and timely journey.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder that holds the main files (source files)
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Future Additions

With the help of Train APIs being released to find our realtime delays or early arrivals of trains the app can be more dynamic and efficent. Also later one the addition of search by destination feature the app would be able to work World Wide!

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
